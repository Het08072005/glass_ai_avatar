# 🚀 AWS DEPLOYMENT DOCUMENTATION

The complete, end-to-end guide for deployment has been moved to:
👉 **[MANUAL_DEPLOY.md](./MANUAL_DEPLOY.md)**

Please refer to that file for:
1.  **SCP upload commands** for the latest WebSocket & AI fixes.
2.  **Server setup commands** (CORS, Env vars).
3.  **The "Reload Sequence"** to restart all services in the correct order.
4.  **Troubleshooting** for WebSocket 1006 and CORS errors.

All recent fixes (Keep-Alive, AI Sync, Prompt Redundancy) are included in that guide.
